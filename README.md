# Crypto-Mainstream-Project

This post can be regarded as the Genesis Block of Crypto Mainstream Project. This post will describe the vision of this project and what we want to do further down the line. This project needs investments to get started!

<h2>The Problem</h2>

There is plenty of educational material about Crypto-related topics. But it’s fragmented and the jargons used by the Devs and Advanced Users are not easy for the newcomers. As a result, the average Joe pivots back to the traditional economy when they come across content that does not make sense to them.
Besides, the wave of DeFi in form of Crypto Farms, the Crypto Farms that pop up everywhere have become alarmingly dangerous grounds to lose fortunes. The same Dev uses anonymous names and cheats the average guy, in the same way, multiple times.

NFTs also have shown how they can revive the faculty of Arts. But a dangerous hype has grown around it where people can lose fortunes buying useless stuff that has little to no value. There is little to no content describing these factors in an easy-to-understand language.

But the biggest problem is there are fewer talks about Blockchain. The time has come when we, the crypto community, should be moving towards replacing every established Web 2.0 market in form of Web 3.0

Platforms like Gitcoin, projects like Coin Market Cap, and exchanges like Binance are playing an admirable role in making Crypto move forward. But it’s not enough. There is a huge gap that can be filled by a project like Crypto Mainstream Project.

The Solution (Crypto Mainstream Project)

Crypto Mainstream Project will aim at building a completely Crypto focused economy where all the transactions will take place in Crypto only.
e.g. There are web hosting websites available that take payments via MasterCard, Visa, Paypal, and many others. But if we launch a web hosting company we will accept crypto payments only.

We will push ethical, real-world Crypto use and ensure wider mainstream adoption of Crypto as a form of payment. To achieve this we will:
- Open a No-BS Educational Website covering Crypto and Blockchain in easy-to-understand language for the mass
- Launch Web 3.0 version of every Web 2.0 established websites
- Launch an interoperable Blockchain
- Create a new Currency and give back to the wallets that help us get the project off the ground

What do we need to make it happen?

To begin with, we will focus on grants. At this moment it’s a one-man team. We will add more team members when we have enough funds. To ensure, I can dedicate full-time to this cause I will require 2 ETH per month salary which I will deduct from the core trusty account. All the transactions will be available via Blockchain and we will keep a public record of where we use every single bit of the grant. If we hire full-time members in the future, they will also receive the same amount of salary per month.
